# To Do:
- Jump
  - Gravity manipulation
  - Longer button press = higher jump

- Slope Detection
  - ~~On grounded, raycast down~~
  - ~~Get angle from collider~~
  - ~~Compare against an allowed maximum angle~~
  - ~~If allowed, increase friction~~ This didn't work, I might have to reconsider using a rigidbody altogether
  
- ~~GroundCheck~~
  - ~~Ground check sphere on player~~
  - ~~Reset jump counter on grounded~~
  
 - Wall climb?
 - Feature toggling
